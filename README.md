The EDOC System is a web-based healthcare platform designed to improve communication between patients and doctors through a secure, digital interface. It allows patients to book appointments, upload medical reports, and access prescriptions online, while doctors can manage appointments, review reports, and issue prescriptions digitally. Administrators can monitor system activities, manage users, and generate analytical insights.
